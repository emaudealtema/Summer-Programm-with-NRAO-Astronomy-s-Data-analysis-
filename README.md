A supernova is a tremendous stellar explosion. A supernova is a transient event which occurs at the end of life of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered 
into a runaway nuclear reaction. The light curve of a supernova is constructed by plotting its magnitude as a function of time.
At the peak of its brightness a supernova can outshine its host galaxy but its light quickly fades away. 
More detailed information about light curves can be found [here] (http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/T/Type+Ia+Supernova+Light+Curves).
